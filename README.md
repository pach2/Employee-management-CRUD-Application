Hi this project is a CRUD (Create, Retrive, Update, Delete) Application, made with C#, Windows form and SQL server (T-SQL). 
The project is an Employee management system that holds an employees information which includes Their ID, name, contact, gender and age.
The program will connect with the local SQL server(if you're trying to run this code on you're PC be sure to change the connection string to your dedicated SQL server address)
A user can add, delete, search for and update an employee information. With a SQL database setup it will also show the availabe information on a table.
